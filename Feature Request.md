# Feature Request Process
### Overview
This section serves as a guide how to handle feature requests received from verticals.  The aim is to categorise feature request and inform the requestor (vertical) in the quickest possible time if the request will be planned for development or if it will be closed. 

1. Receive feature request from the vertical via Zendesk.  
   *Note: If the request was received via a different channel (i.e. Slack, Email, Verbal) please make sure that a ticket is 
    created in Zendesk
   
2. Check if the feature requested has already been requested or is already in the Dev queue.  
   - If there's previous request: Update the requestor that a ticket has already been submitted and let him / her know the 
     status. Close the ticket
     
   - If there's no previous request: Check if all the required information was provided.  If at any point more information is      needed, coomunicate with the vertical to complete the feature request form

3. Once the form is completed categorise the request based on the categories below and tag the ticket "Feature Request - Category".  Tagging the ticket will allow us to retrieve all the tickets under that category with ease.
   
   - Planned : Request is valid and we are able to commit to delivering the functionality at this time
   
   - Open: The request is valid but we cannot commit to delivering the functionality at this time
 Â  
   - Short Term: Request is being considered for the next product version which means that these issues can be moved to 
     Planned or Open
   
   - Long Term: Request is being considered for the future product version which means that the issues here can be moved to 
     short term or open categories.
   
   - Closed: Request has reached its end state.  There are several reasons why the ticket could be closed, either the request 
     has been done, we won't do the request or if its a duplicate request.

4. After tagging, create a JIRA ticket.  The JIRA ticket should contain the following information:

Information from the Vertical / Requestor:
   - Define the problem: Explain the curent scenario
   - What is the desired / expected outcome
   - What are the metrics?  How will we measure success?

Information from the support team:   
   - Are there any pre-requisites?
   - In Scope: List of things that fall within the scope of this request?
   - Out of Scope: List of that are not to be included in the first phase of the project
   - Conflicts / Unresolved items: List anything that needs to be flagged and discussed
   - Other Verticals: How will this request affect other verticals?
