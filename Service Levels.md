# Service Level Definition
### Severity 1 (Critical) 
Critical production issue that severly impacts your use of the service.  The situation halts your business operations and no procedural work around exists
### Severity 2 (Major)
Major functionality is impacted or significant performance degredation is experienced.  The situation is causing a high impact to portions of your business and no reasonable work around exists.  Service is operational but highly degraded to the point of major impact on usage
### Severity 3 (Minor) 
There is a partial, non-critical loss of use of service with a medium-to-low impact on your business, but your business continues to function.  Short term workaround is available, but not scalable.
### Severity 4 (Cosmetic)
Inquiry regarding a routine technical issue; information requested on application capabilities, navigation or configuration; bug affecting a small number of users. Acceptable workaround available
