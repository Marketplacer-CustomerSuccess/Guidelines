# Service Process

The Marketplacer customer support centre is the primary channel of communication for the service.  All requests must be routed through this tool.  If you are unable to find the answer to your question through http://support.marketplacer.com then you will need to create a technical support request

There are two ways to create a technical support request.  

1. Send an email via support@marketplacer.com.  To speed up the process, when your email is sent please indicate the following details:

- What is the issue about?
- What is your expected outcome?
- What is the current scenario?
- Please include screenshots and links if any

2. Go to https://marketplacer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new and create a technical support request.  

- Create a technical support request
- Choose the problem area to which your request relates to
- Indicate the following details
  
  What is the issue about?
  
  What is your expected outcome?
  
  What is the current scenario?
 

Some things to take note of when creating / submitting a technical support request:

- Please make sure that the correct problem area is chosen to speed up the the resolution of your service requests.  This is essential so we can route the request to our team of experts to resolve your issue.  
- You will need to provide as much details as possible including screenshots, links and examples.  This will enable the engineers to replicate and solve your issue.

3. On receipt of the service request, a Customer Success Manager will review it and will request for further information if needed.  Please note that if the request requires further information the resolution time will be dependent on your response time

4. If the request requires  further action, the request will be routed to our engineering team to resolve.

5. You will be kept informed about the progress of any open requests via email and through the Marketplacer customer support center

Please note that the response time is dependent on your package level.  (See Msaas service level packages)
